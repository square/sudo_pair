## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Pre-built bindings are now committed for x86, x86-64, and aarch64 targets.
- Bindings may be generated at compile-time for additional architectures with
  the `bindgen` feature.
- Added constants for log function return values.

### Changed
- This project will now adopt the upstream sudo_plugin version number for future
  releases.

### Removed

- Removed `sudo_printf_non_null_t`.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-03-27

### Fixed

- [Fixed on 32-bit architectures][issue-59]; bindgen output cannot be
  committed directly, since it's architecture-dependent

[issue-59]: https://github.com/square/sudo_pair/issues/59

## [1.2.0] - 2020-03-26

### Changed
- Builds using Rust 2018
- No longer fails to build on warnings, unless being run in CI
- Bindgen-generated bindings are committed directly so we can remove
  bindgen from the list of build dependencies

## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-18

## Changed
- Updated to use bindgen 0.37, which changes the mutability of some pointer parameters

## [1.0.1] - 2018-05-08

### Fixed
- Preferentially use bundled sudo_plugin.h

## 1.0.0 - 2018-05-07

### Added
- Bindings automatically generated for [sudo_plugin(8)](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.22/sudo_plugin.man.html)
- Provides default `sudo_plugin.h` which will be used if none is found on the system
