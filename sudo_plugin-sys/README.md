Autogenerated FFI definitions for the [sudo_plugin(8)][sudo_plugin_man]
facility.

## Sudo Plugin API Version

This crate matches its version to the upstream [sudo_plugin(8)][sudo_plugin_man]
API version it implements and will use patch versions to indicate internal fixes
to the crate.

Historically, the `sudo_plugin(8)` binary interface has been
backwards-compatible with previous versions and respected semantic versioning
practices. Since we track the upstream version numbering scheme, we believe this
project can also respect semantic versioning but cannot make this a guarantee.

Later versions of this plugin *should* be backward-compatible with older
versions of the `sudo_plugin(8)` interface. However, the user of this API is
responsible for checking the sudo front-end API version before using certain
features. Please consult the [manpage][sudo_plugin_man] to identify which
features require version probing.

## Building

This crate includes pregenerated bindings for `x86`, `x86-64`, and `aarch64`
architectures and will use them by default when building with Cargo.

```sh
cargo build
```

For other architectures, you'll need to build with the `bindgen` feature
enabled. This will generate bindings from the copy of `sudo_plugin.h` bundled
with this library.

```sh
cargo build --features bindgen
```

As releases of this library are built with a specific version of the plugin API
in mind, we do not currently support building against external versions of this
header. Since newer versions of the sudo plugin interface are binary-compatible
with older versions (and vice versa), doing so should not be necessary. If you
find a use-case that requires this, please [let us know][new-issue].
