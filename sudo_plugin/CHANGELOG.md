## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Incorporated `plugin_name` and `plugin_version` into the `Plugin` struct
- `Drop::drop` is called on plugins when sudo exits

### Changed
- Wrapped `printf_facility` plugin argument into a dedicated `PrintFacility`
  struct to wrap all user communication.
- Moved much of the work done in the `sudo_io_plugin!` macro to non-macro code.
- Almost complete rewrite of the internals to be more Rust-like, and use traits
  to reduce the amount of macro magic necessary.
- Autodetect what version of the `sudo_plugin` API is supported by the version
  of `sudo_plugin-sys` we're linked against.
- Now uses a prelude-style import.
- Replaced error-chain with thiserror.
- Completely reworked error handling. Plugin implementations may now provide
  coercions from sudo_plugin internal errors to appropriate return codes. The
  provided `Error` type defaults to aborting the session on error.
- Plugins no longer mutable when calling `log_*` functions.

### Fixed
- Panics inside of plugins no longer cause undefined behavior by
  crossing FFI boundaries. All panics are caught at the boundaries and
  turned into an appropriate error type.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-03-26

### Added
- Automatic support for `-V` flag, which prints the version of `sudo` and any
  active plugins

### Changed
- Builds using Rust 2018
- No longer fails to build on warnings, unless being run in CI
- Allows plugins to use any error library they wish, as long as the error
  types returned in `Result`s implement `Into<sudo_plugin::errors::Error>`.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-18

### Added
- Support writing directly to the user's TTY

### Changed
- `UserInfo::tty` is now a `PathBuf` instead of a `String`.
- Depends on `sudo_plugin-sys` ~1.1, which changed mutability of pointer arguments due to bindgen 0.37

## 1.0.0 - 2018-05-07

### Added
- Macros to simplify writing sudo plugins
- Full compatibility with plugin API versions up to 1.12
